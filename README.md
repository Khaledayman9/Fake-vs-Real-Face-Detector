# Fake-vs-Real-Face-Detector
A deep learning model that basically acts as a discriminator between real and fake faces. This implementation includes two models, one model is in implemented using TensorFlow and the other is implemented using PyTorch.


# Setup
## Dataset
  * It is basically a dataset from the Kaggle website named [Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard)]([https://www.github.com/Khaledayman9](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzaboulahia/hardfakevsrealfaces)).
  * The is relatively small which includes in total 1288 face images. 
  * The number of fake samples is 700 and the number of real samples is 589.
